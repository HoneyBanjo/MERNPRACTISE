            <h2> How does this app work? </h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Well...</h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    First you add your details to your profile <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Based on this information AI will search medical researches and suggest the best workouts suited for you. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    You can ask suggestions again as many times as you want <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Once you have found a nice workout, you can add it to your session. <br/>
                    <br/>

                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Don't really need AI right now? <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Dont even worry about it. You can add workouts of your own and remove them as you please. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    AI is here to support and give inspiration, but there is no escaping the work you have to put in yourself <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Oh and also: Your workouts are stored in your history! So if you want to see development, or add a workout <br/>
                    or a session to your favorites, thats possible.<br/>
                </p>
